# Getting started with Mindiâ„¢ simulation


## Configuration:


### Mindi Simulation
![Mindi](images/mplab-mindi-analog-simulator.png)

Download and open the **Mindi schematic [here](https://github.com/microchip-pic-avr-examples/pic16f17146-current-to-voltage-conveter-using-OPA-mindi/releases/latest)**

Press the _play_ button to simulate with an example stimulus source.

### Tweaking


### Updating composer fields
Once the desired result has been verified with Mindi simulation, the corrected values should be moved back into MCC/Start by copying resistor configuration values across to the composer of your preference.

### Don't have Mindi?
You can download and install the [Mindi simulation tool](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-mindi), or use another SPICE simulator of your own preference. For use with different simulators, a plain spice model can be found in "Opamp_AVR_DB.txt" to replace the mindi-optimized ".lb"
